An application intended for bloggers with CMS
A projected application, allowing bloggers to write, insert images, edit and delete each blog individually.
System where every blog can be separated into different categories. Complete login and logout with two roles, “admin” and “author”.
The site owner can add new users and assign them different roles, by that choosing the level of authorization for each user.
Noting that every user was able to customize their profile as they prefferred. Created site pagination with the help of Hibernate Queries.
Additional functions were also created, for example: Blog search & sorting per category (tags, authors etc.), most prominent posts, date subtraction for each blog and other crucial web site tools for best performance.
